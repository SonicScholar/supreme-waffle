Data Storage
Want to store level info in bits of the item if possible. This makes the wands and spellbooks transferrable. The ‘damage value’ of an item is a short integer (16 bits)
There are 4 attributes, with 6 levels each. This can be stored in 4 heximal (base 6) digits
Highest decimal number needed = 6^4 = 1296. Binary is 101,0001,0000 (11 bits)


5 bits left for storing level future information

XP will be stored in a book in the user’s inventory called “Spellbook” if we use the XP level scheme above, I’ll only need 10 bits to use as the XP counter as long as the xp needed stays under 1024.

Other Options
	Wands based on “shrines” (i.e. shrine of coal blocks allows wand to find coal). Would have to be charged or placed on the shrine for a certain amount of time to find that item, and can only find one type at a time or at all. Then leveling up only needs to be distance, cooldown and vein mining and such. This way, you have to find a lot of diamond before you can “train” the wand to find it.
