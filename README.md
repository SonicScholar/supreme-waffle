# Adventurers 

An ancient magic in the world of Minecraft has been rediscovered. Deep in the heart of the nether fortress there lies a forgotten lore that helped adventurers in the ancient past. Behold, the ancient art of using magic wands for discovery of valuable materials and manipulation of the environment has resurfaced after millennia of being all but forgotten!

To learn more about this ancient and powerful magic, please continue following along and we’ll do our best to pass on the ways using magic wands so it is never forgotten again.

## Getting started 

Magic wands are made from a rare magic that resides only inside of blaze monsters in the nether. Together, this magic combined with a channeling medium in the form of a blaze rod composes a magic wand.

The adventurers of old knew, though, that every wand must have it's strength proven and tested before the imbued magic could be harnessed to its full power. Legend has it that only magic wands with the strength to cripple obsidian are worthy of being embedded with magic.

To create a magic wand, take a blaze rod and try to destroy an obsidian block. This will take around 4 minutes which is hard work! But it’s necessary in order to test the wand to see if it’s worthy. Fair warning, there is a 10% chance that the wand cannot cripple the obsidian block and the blaze rod will turn into blaze powder.

If your blaze rod survives, then it will automagically (get it?) turn into a wand!

## Uses for your Magic Wand

There are two main uses for a blaze rod magic wand: mining and searching for minerals.
To mine, left click with the magic wand in your hand. It will mine out a 3x3 square in front of you.
To search, right click with the magic wand in your hand. It will search a 3x3 square in front of you.
The distance that blocks are mined can be leveled up.
You level up by getting XP from mining. XP values per type of block are listed below.
